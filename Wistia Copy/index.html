        <p><strong>Is there a catch?</strong>
            Nope, no funny business. All it takes to start your account is your email address and a few other pieces of information. We don't even ask for your credit card.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Are there any limits?</strong>
            The Free plan has room for five videos and comes with 200GB of <a href="index.html">bandwith</a> per month. After you've uploaded 5 videos, you can upgrade to a <a href="index.html">paid plan</a> for more space. If your videos exceed 200GB of bandwith in a given month, they'll stop playing until your bandwith resets at the start of the next month. Don't worry though, we've found 200GB of monthly bandwith is enough for 95% fo all users. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Do I have to worry about you selling my email or data?</strong>
        No. Your contact information and private data are yours and yours alone. They're safe with us. We'll email you about product and company updates, but you can opt out at any time. Learn more about our <a href="index.html">privacy policy</a>.
